### What is Packer?

Packer is an open-source DevOps tool developed by HashiCorp, designed to create identical machine images, popularly known as "golden images," which serve as blueprints for multiple platforms. It automates the creation of various machine images, including AWS AMIs, Azure machine templates, Docker containers, VMware machine templates, and more, ensuring consistent software configurations across all deployment environments.
